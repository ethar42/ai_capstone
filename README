This is a Flask web application that provides a text summarization service using the Groq API. Here's a breakdown of its functionality:

Setup and Configuration:
    Uses Flask for the web framework
    Integrates with Groq's API for text summarization
    Creates an uploads directory for temporary file storage
    Uses a hardcoded API key for Groq authentication

Main Route ('/'):
    Handles both GET and POST requests
    GET: Displays a submission form (submit.html)
    POST: Processes file uploads and generates summaries

File Processing Flow:
    Validates the submitted API key
    Accepts only .txt files
    Temporarily saves uploaded files
    Reads the file content
    Sends the content to Groq's API for summarization
    Cleans up by deleting the uploaded file after processing

Groq Integration:
    Uses the "llama-3.3-70b-versatile" model
    Sets temperature to 0.3 for more focused outputs
    Limits response to 1000 tokens
    Returns the summary to a result template

Security Features:
    API key validation
    File type restriction (.txt only)
    Temporary file handling with cleanup

The application follows a simple workflow: users upload a text file through a web interface, the content is processed by Groq's AI model to generate a summary, and the result is displayed to the user. The code includes basic error handling for cases like missing files, invalid file types, and incorrect API keys.

Note: The API key is currently hardcoded in the script, which is not a secure practice. In a production environment, this should be moved to an environment variable or secure configuration management system.
